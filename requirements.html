                    <h2> What Is Required?</h2>
                    <p>While cats are generally low maintenance compared to dogs the responsibility 
                        of owning a cat should not be taken lightly. Cats can typically live between 12-18 years
                         which means they are a long commitment, there are several different factors that should 
                         be considered when adopting a cat. Factors such as do they have a suitable environment 
                         to live in? What expectations do I have about owning a cat? Do I have the time commitment?

                    <p>In addition, cats will also require a lot of <centre><a href="https://icatcare.org/advice/thinking-of-getting-a-cat/">necessities</a></centre>, aside from just the basic needs 
                        cats will need to be provided with a fair amount of human companionship, a stimulating and 
                        safe environment. They will need their vaccinations, to be groomed, a scratching post and a 
                        clean and comfortable bed. It is also important to understand that all cats are different and
                         how each cat will interact with you is inherent on personality and early life. The environment 
                         in which you live will also  affect a cat greatly, what other pets do you have? Do you live
                          with children or infants? Answering some of these questions will better help you become 
                          more understanding of your expectations about owning a cat. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Cats also come in many shapes and sizes, depending on the breed of the cat some will be long-haired,
                         short-haired, striped, and spotted too. There is a large variety of cat breed that comes with their 
                         own sets of personality, skills, and physical differences. If your specific to a certain breed of cat 
                         itâ€™s worth it to do some research into different breed to make sure you are well informed on the specifics 
                         and needs of that breed of cat.
