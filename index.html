                    <h2> Why Cats?</h2>
                    <p> While it seems straight forward if not for the whiskers, meows and purrs, cats
                         are good for our mental health too. Spending time with our cats is proven to 
                         release oxytocin in our brain, this is the ‘love hormone’ and can contribute 
                         to feelings of trust and relaxation. This can help improve our mental health 
                         by decreasing stress we feel and offering companionship and acting as our very 
                         own therapy animal. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Studies have shown and proven that the physical affects can even be therapeutic 
                        for illness in humans, a cat purrs between a range of 20-140 hz. So not only can 
                        a cat lower stress but can also help with laboured breathing, lower blood pressure,
                         heal infection and even bones! The Mental Health Foundation conducted a study in
                          2011 and found that 87% of people who had a cat said it had a positive effect on 
                          their well-being.
