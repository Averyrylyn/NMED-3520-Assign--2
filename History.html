                    <h2> A Brief History Of Cats </h2>
                    <p> Cats are some of the most popular pets in the world, 
                        they can be found anywhere from homes to television
                        and overwhelmingly on the internet. It’s a wonder 
                        why they became so popular to begin with.
                        It seems like cats have always been around, 
                        however the cats we are familiar with today have 
                        been naturally domesticated to have the qualities 
                        and appearances they do now. </p>
                    <p> While it is assumed that our feline friends originally descended 
                        from the <centre><a href="https://catspride.com/our-blog/brief-history-human-ownership-cats/#:~:text=Thought%20to%20have%20descended%20from,sacred%20creatures%20by%20the%20Egyptians">African wild cat</a></centre> given, they share similar qualities. 
                        A burial site in Cyprus was the first archaeological find that
                         indicated that cats lived alongside humans, as far as 9,500 years ago.</p>
                    <p>The domesticated cat can be traced back to Egypt 4,000 years ago. 
                        They were most likely useful in Egypt because they helped reduce disease 
                        and protected crops from pests. Cats were quickly regarded as sacred creatures
                         in Egypt. When Egypt became part of The Roman empire cats became widespread 
                         across Europe around the 4th century AD. From Europe it’s thought that cats
                          made their way over to America by boarding ships. 
                           By the end of the 19th century cats were starting to be kept as company in America. 
                            And by World war I cats were commonly accepted as pets in the US. Over thousands
                         of years, a new species of cat eventually evolved and naturally made their homes around people.
